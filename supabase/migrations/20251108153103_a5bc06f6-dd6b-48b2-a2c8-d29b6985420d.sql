-- Fix avatar upload RLS policies
-- The issue: during signup, auth.uid() might not match yet because session is being established
-- Solution: Allow any authenticated user to upload, but keep folder structure for organization

-- Drop the old restrictive policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload their own avatar" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own avatar" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own avatar" ON storage.objects;

-- Create new, more permissive policies for authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload avatars"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'avatars');

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can update avatars"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can delete avatars"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');
